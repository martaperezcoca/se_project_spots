#### Plan on improving the project

While developing this project, I realized that a few changes could make it more attractive and enhance the user experience:

**Contacts section**

Objective: make social media information more visually attractive to increase the user engagement. This could be achieved with a few small changes:

1. **Social Media Icons**: Increase the size of the icons and maybe give them some animations to draw the attention of the user.

2. **Links to Facebook and Instagram**: Increase the font of Facebook and Instragram links, to ensure they stands out.

These changes could encourage users to connect with the Triple Peaks Coffee Shop more often, imporving their visibility in social media.
